<h2>  Maligcong Rice Terraces (Bontoc)    </h2>
<br>
<p> 

Considered as the pride of the people of Maligcong, the Maligcong Rice Terraces is known for its stone walls which make the terraces more stable and stand erosion.

Upon reaching the turning point of Maligcong, one can already see the Maligcong Rice Terraces. There is no entrance fee for visiting the Maligcong Rice Terraces. You walk by this attraction while going to the barangay proper. The rice terraces here are more awesome as the main village is right at the center of the sprawling fields.

The best time to visit Maligcong Rice Terraces is during the month of April and May when the fields are green as palay planted in March have started to grow. Harvest time is August.

This “Stairways to the Sky” is definitely a site to visit.

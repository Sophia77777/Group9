<h2>   Balbalasang National Park (Balbalan)    </h2>
<br>
<p> 
An important center for biodiversity conservation, the park is home to 89 species of birds, of which 39 are endemic to the Philippines and 2 of them can only be found in Luzon, the Isabela oriole (Oriolus isabellae) and flame-breasted fruit dove (Ptilinopus marchei). While none of the recorded species in the park is critical or endangered, four species of birds are categorized vulnerable (2002 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species), among them are the whiskered pitta (Pitta kochi), Luzon water-redstart (Ryacornis bicolor) and Luzon jungle flycatcher (Rhinomyas insignis).

In addition, 23 species of mammals, 13 species of amphibians, 13 species of reptiles and 25 species of earthworms have also been documented. Among them are the Philippine warty pig, Luzon striped rat, Northern Luzon giant cloud rat, Kalinga narrowmouth toad, and Luzon narrow-mouthed frog. Two of these mammal species are listed as endangered, namely the Luzon pygmy fruit bat and the Luzon bushy-tailed cloud rat.

At elevations above 1,000 m., the park consists of hardwood, pine and mossy forests. A species of Rafflesia flower has also been discovered in the park.

The Balbalasang National Park in Balbalan, Kalinga is protected by the Elders of Balbalasang and the Banao tribe. Due to numerous natural disasters, strict guidelines have been imposed to preserve the forest. Anyone caught violating the rules would be fined, including giving a full-grown carabao (local water buffalo) to the community. Any logging that must be done is only for building houses and other justifiable reasons.

<h2>  Lubo Rice Terraces (Tanudan)    </h2>
<br>
<p> 
The Lubo and Mangali Rice Terraces surround the villages of Lubo. The best time to view the rice terraces is during the planting season and when the rice terraces are already ready for harvest.
Rice paddies carved on mountainsides are a common sight in Northern Luzon, including in Kalinga. The terraces can be considered an engineering wonder, but the star of it all is the fruit of the local’s hard work. Kalinga offers some of the best rice varieties in the world, so you might want to time your visit during harvest season. You should also visit during the planting season, and when the rice is ready for harvest.

People are very nice. They have a culture everybody will love. Their coffee is great! Vegetables are fresh and rice is awesome :)

If you think you’ve had enough of the caves, rivers and lakes, head up to Elephant Hill in Rizal, where you will find the remains of an elephant. Since this gentle giant is a rarity in the Philippines, the archaeological dig site has become a tourist attraction.

<h2>  Buaya Cave    </h2>
<br>
<p> 

Buaya is a local term for crocodile, but you won’t see any of these ferocious reptiles in the Buaya Caves. Instead, you will see the usual stalactites and stalagmites formation that make any cave a natural wonder. Because Buaya Caves are made up a number of caves that cover the whole mountain slope, which are interconnected with each other, it is best to explore it with a local guide.

<h2>   Tattoo artist, Apo Whang Od    </h2>
<br>
<p> 

    One thing you should not miss when visiting Kalinga is to get a tattoo from Apo Whang-Od, the last traditional tattoo artist of the Kalingas. This may not be an attraction per se, but an experience worth exploring.

Apo Whang-Od is over 90 years old but still does an amazing job in tattooing. Being traditional and all, she only uses two bamboo sticks attached to each other, with a calamansi (local lemon) thorn for a needle. She hammers on one end of the bamboo stick so the calamansi thorn pierces the skin. It may hurt like crazy, but it will be worth it. After all, the tattoo is a tradition that has been done for over a thousand years, and Apo Whang-Od is the last known artist today.

<h2>   Batad Rice Terraces    </h2>
<br>
<p> 

Batad is a secluded community up in the heart of The Cordilleras. It is home to the remarkable amphitheater rice terraces which is one of the UNESCO Heritage Sites in the World. Surrounded by formidable mountains such as Aya and Amuyao, Batad for a long time is a paradise safely tucked away from the prying eyes of the outside world and only those who brave the unknown knew what an exquisite beauty it once was. It still is a marvelous sight today and what made it so interesting is that their culture has remained untouched. The locals still practice their olden rituals, speak their olden tongue and remained unchanged amidst the surge of foreign influence.
<br>
Batad is definitely a priceless treasure, a remant of a great culture which has once thrived in the mountainous Ifugao province and is a vital part of our civilization. In the moments when the bright light of our cities make you lose sight of your essence as a proud Filipino, look beyond the skyscrapers obscuring the evening stars and simply remember that up in our mountains, our cultural heritage lives on.

<h2>   Banaue Rice Terraces    </h2>
<br>
<p> 
The Banaue Rice Terraces (Filipino: Hagdan-hagdang Palayan ng Banawe) are 2,000-year-old terraces that were carved into the mountains of Ifugao in the Philippines by ancestors of the indigenous people. Therefore, they are regarded as the oldest rice terraces in the world. They are frequenty called the "Eighth Wonder of the World". It is commonly thought that the terraces were built with minimal equipment, largely by hand. The terraces are located approximately 1500 metres (5000 ft) above sea level. They are fed by an ancient irrigation system from the rainforests above the terraces. It is said that if the steps were put end to end, it would encircle half the globe.
<br>
Locals to this day still plant rice and vegetables on the terraces, although more and more younger Ifugaos do not find farming appealing, often opting for the more lucrative hospitality industry generated by the terraces[citation needed]. The result is the gradual erosion of the characteristic "steps", which need constant reconstruction and care. In 2010, a further problem was drought, with the terraces drying up completely in March of that year.

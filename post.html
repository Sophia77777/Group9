<h2>Most Visited Places in the Cordilleras that were preserved by our Ancestors</h2>

<h2>Baguio- Home of the Pines</h2>
      <p>Baguio City perched on top of mountains and among the clouds
Baguio City, the de facto capital of the Philippine Cordilleras, is a city I have grown to love. Though much of it is being rapidly developed, it is still quite a travel experience being in a city perched on top of mountains and among the clouds with an elevation of 1,600 meters above sea level. It certainly helps that the city’s climate is cooler than any other city in the country and that it is home to a number of fantastic restaurants, one of which is the vegetarian restaurant cum art gallery Oh My Gulay. If only for Oh My Gulay, Baguio is worth a visit.</p>

<h2> The Halsema Highway</h2>
      <p>Crop terraces viewed from the highest highway in the Philippines, the Halsema Highway
The highest mountain range in the Philippines happens to have one of the most scenic drives in the country. The Halsema Highway begins in La Trinidad, Benguet right outside Baguio City and winds through the gorgeous mountain scenery of the Philippine Cordilleras featuring rice terraces, verdant valleys, deep gorges and dizzying cliffs. The highway even climbs up to 2,200 meters above sea level in a section of the road near Atok in Benguet. Views from up here are stunning. The road passes through the capital of Mountain Province Bontoc before winding down to Tabuk in Kalinga. Many hours later, you suddenly find 800 new photos in your camera. </p>

<h2>Wright Park</h2>
      <p>Here found the much photographed Pool Of Pines, a rectangular pool of water surrounded by flowers and pine trees but it’s more famous to locals and tourists alike as the place where you can ride horses with over a hundred of them to choose from. You can also have a photo taken unlimited wearing native costumes for the price of 20 pesos per person.</p>

<h2>Sagada</h2>
      <p>The hanging coffins of the local Ifugao people of Sagada
The small town of Sagada in the Philippine Cordilleras has often been described as Baguio many years ago. I cannot say that for certain as I never saw what they were many years ago. What I can say is that the distinctive customs of the locals of Sagada here such as hanging the coffins of their dead on the side of the cliff are worth coming here. It helps that Sagada is also an outdoorsman’s paradise. Here, there’s trekking, swimming by the waterfalls, rafting, spelunking and a ton of other stuff to do.</p>

<h2>Strawberry Farm</h2>
      <p>ocated in La Trinidad, a nearby town in the outskirts of Baguio City are the vast strawberry farms. Here you can choose the type of strawberries you want from small to big ones or from half ripened to the fully ripened ones as you are picking them yourselves. Be careful though not to be too excited to pick every strawberry you see as the cost is triple times higher than the price of strawberries sold in the market, but getting to pick your own strawberries which you can bring home to families and friends with the touch of love is priceless. </p>

<h2>Benguet - Salad Bowl Of The Philippines</h2>
<br>
<p> Today it holds claim as the "Salad Bowl of the Philippines" because of the huge production of upland vegetables.

Agriculture, small and large scale mining, gold panning, silver craft/ brass wares, gift and toy making, strawberry production, livestock and poultry, tiger grass broom making production.

Rural industries include silver craft / brass wares, woodcraft, loom weaving, handmade paper decors and novelty items, garment knitting; sericulture and fruit vegetable processing such as strawberry jams, fruit jellies, candies, and preserves.

<h2>Kalinga - Whitewater Rafting Capital Of The North</h2>
      <p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION 
A glance of the Philippine map will easily reveal the similarity of the physiography of Kalinga to that of a bust of a man akin to former President Ferdinand E. Marcos. The province’s geographic feature is charcterized in the western portion by sharp crested interlinking peaks of the steep slope, isolated flat lands, plateaus, and valleys. The eastern portion has generally rolling, gradually sloping foothills. With interlocking wide tracks of flat lands and flood plains along its main drainage system, this rare geography interposes a great role expected of the province in national development pursuits.

GEOGRAPHY 
Kalinga is nestled on an elevation of 300 to 5,000 feet above sea level with a northsouth assemblage of mountain ranges within the Cordillera Central. It has been dubbed as the “Prince of the Highlands” in the Philippines.

POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS 
The province is composed of eight (8) municipalities: Balbalan, Lubuagan, Pasil, Pinukpuk, Rizal, Tabuk, Tanudan, and Tinglayan. </p>

<h2> Banaue (pronounced bah-nah-weh)</h2>
      <p>Banaue’s signature landscape: a rice stairway to heaven
No other image best represents the Philippine Cordilleras other than the rice terraces which generations of local Ifugao people have constructed here in a bid to temper the land that they have been given. The grand green terraces are indeed a sight to behold that UNESCO noticed and named it a World Heritage Site. Banaue is just the jump-off point. There are many rice terraces here such as Batad and Mayaoyao to last you your whole trip.

There is a reason for which I am writing about the Philippine Cordilleras at this point. By the time this post is published, I will actually be in the Philippine Cordilleras. The first three in the list, I have done. The final two should be easy. I hope. </p>

<h2>Kennon Road</h2>
      <p>This is the shortest route to Baguio City for travelers coming from Manila. Although, it has made headlines due to many vehicular accidents, it still is a favorite route going to the city as it offers breathtaking views along the way. Also along Kennon Rd., is the famous tourist attraction, the 43-feet high limestone sculpted Lion’s Head. The viewing deck at the upper end of Kennon Rd is the one famous to tourists for its spectacular view of the entire stretch of the highway and the surrounding mountains covered in greens.

<h2>Tam-awan Village</h2>
      <p>Tam-awan Village was built to restore the Ifugao and Kalinga villages in Baguio City to give those people who haven’t been to the Cordilleras the experience of living immersed through the cultures of these natives. It has become an artists village as it is host to several art exhibits for artists from all over the city and beyond. It has an art gallery which houses paintings and other art pieces. </p>
